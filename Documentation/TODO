People Involved and their responsibilities
==========================================

Plan for the next 3 months
==========================

* Item 1
Review savahhan bugs, make them active and assign them to appropriate people
* Item 2
Place all bug reports into one place, where?
* Item 3
Review dashboard integration with WEBTOOLS and it's overall design
* Item 4
Outline plans for release integration into WEBTOOLS
* Item 5
Outline plans for nightly packaing integration into WEBTOOLS
* Item 6
Add standard directory structure for WEBTOOLS deployment on back-end nodes,
cmswt01 and cmswt02. Assign operator to perform installation and update.
* Item 7
Outline plans for failover on front-end nodes
* Item 8
Review SSL rules on front-end nodes, pass back to back-ends the user credentials.
* Item 9
Fix masthead to avoid relative paths, otherwise off-site installation and stand-alone modes
do not work.
* Item 10
Web-services, REST and AJAX responses
* Item 11
service configuration template
* Item 12
common templates for tables, lists, selects, etc.
The template should contains common tags/attributes, such as ability to
pass around style, size, etc. We also need to agree how to pass python
object to such template, I would vote for generic dictionary, but it  
may not work for all cases.
* Item 13
since we use AJAX quite a lot we can think of common framework class
which will create AJAX response in a common way.
* Item 14
create a common JavaScript library, I have a lot of functions which can
be used everywhere, such as ShowTag, HideTag, enable/disable certain
elements, etc.
* Item 15
it would be nice to delegate to framework the auto-load of
schema. Handling various DB back-ends and query generation. I'm  
already doing this stuff, but it may not work for all projects.
