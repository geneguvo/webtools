Environment:
============
    
    export APACHE_CONF_DIR=/etc/httpd/conf.d

Before you start:
=================

Make sure you can ssh as root on the frontend machines.

    ssh -t root@vocms09.cern.ch echo "OK. Can connect to vocms09.cern.ch" 2>/dev/null
    ssh -t root@vocms08.cern.ch echo "OK. Can connect to vocms08.cern.ch" 2>/dev/null
    
which should print out the following:

    OK. Can connect to vocms09.cern.ch
    OK. Can connect to vocms08.cern.ch

If not, please ask to Andreas Pfeiffer to add to the list of the people who can
access to the machine.

Environment
===========

We assume that the following variables are used in the following instructions.

    export APACHE_CONF_DIR=/etc/httpd/conf.d
    export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cmscvs.cern.ch/cvs_server/repositories/CMSSW"

Moreover the a variable is used to specify the version of the rules to pick up
from cvs. This might change over time, so always ask which one is the one to 
use.

    export RULES_TAG=WT_CONFIG_1
    

First time configuration of the front-end redirections:
=======================================================

This is what is needed to configure the frontends so that they pick up their configuration
from cvs.
First of all make sure you back up the old configuration (do it only once).

    [ "X$APACHE_CONF_DIR" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $APACHE_CONF_DIR set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cd $APACHE_CONF_DIR
    [ -e /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites.cnf.backup ] && echo "This should be done only once." && exit 1
    [ -d /etc/httpd/conf.d ] || { echo "Apache not installed. Contact administrator." && exit 1 ; }
    [ -e /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites.cnf ] && cp /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites.cnf /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites.cnf.backup
    [ -e /etc/httpd/conf.d/rewrites.cnf.backup ] || { echo "Unable to do the backup. Ask for help." && exit 1; }

Then check-out from cvs the configuration (only once):

    [ "X$APACHE_CONF_DIR" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $APACHE_CONF_DIR set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cd $APACHE_CONF_DIR
    cvs -d $CVSROOT login
    # Password is 98passwd
    cvs -d $CVSROOT co -r $RULES_TAG -d webtools-cfg COMP/WEBTOOLS/Configuration/
    
Then create the links to the correct configuration:
    
    [ "X$APACHE_CONF_DIR" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $APACHE_CONF_DIR set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cd $APACHE_CONF_DIR
    [ -d $APACHE_CONF_DIR/webtools-cfg ] || { echo 'You do not have a webtools-cfg directory. Read better the instructions.' && exit 1 ; }
    ln -sf $APACHE_CONF_DIR/webtools-cfg/rewrites.cnf $APACHE_CONF_DIR/rewrites.cnf
    [ -h $APACHE_CONF_DIR/rewrites.cnf ] || { echo 'Unable to create the link. Ask for help.' && exit 1 ; }

Test that the new configuration is correct:

    service httpd configtest

Restart apache

    apachectl restart

Updating rules on the frontend machines.
========================================

Make sure you repeat the following instructions for both vocms08 and vocms09.
This is what to do to update the rules on the frontend. First of all you need 
get a tag for the rules that you need. This is given by a developer.

    
Then execute the following:

    [ "X$APACHE_CONF_DIR" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $APACHE_CONF_DIR set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cd $APACHE_CONF_DIR/webtools-cfg
    cvs -d $CVSROOT login
    # Password is 98passwd
    cvs -d $CVSROOT update -r $RULES_TAG

Then restart apache with:

    apachectl restart

Checking that everything works
==============================

In order to consider an update successful, the following things must be checked:

* <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/> must show the initial index page for cmsweb.
* <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/prodrequest> must show the initial webtools page.
* <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/sitedb> must show the initial sitedb page.
* <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/dbs_discovery> must show the initial dbs page.
* <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/prodmon> must show the initial prodmon page.
* <https://cmsweb.cern.ch/conddb> must show the conddb pages.

Whoever updates the rules **MUST** complete the checklist before considering the 
update done.
