Before you start:
=================

Make sure you can ssh as root on the frontend machines.

    ssh -t root@vocms09.cern.ch echo "OK. Can connect to vocms09.cern.ch" 2>/dev/null
    ssh -t root@vocms08.cern.ch echo "OK. Can connect to vocms08.cern.ch" 2>/dev/null
    
which should print out the following:

    OK. Can connect to vocms09.cern.ch
    OK. Can connect to vocms08.cern.ch

If not, please ask to Andreas Pfeiffer to add to the list of the people who can
access to the machine.
The following procedure needs to be done on BOTH the frontend servers.


Environment
===========

Set up the necessary environment on the frontend machines. This needs to be done
before you do anything else. This will never change.

    
    export APACHE_HTDOCS=/var/www/
    export CVSROOT=":pserver:anonymous@cmscvs.cern.ch/cvs_server/repositories/CMSSW"
    
Moreover you need to have a tag for COMP/WEBTOOLS/WelcomePages that you want to 
deploy this changes from deployment to deployment. Ask the developer who wanted 
you to do the deployment if you don't know what to do.

    export WELCOME_TAG=CHANGE_ME
    

Installing the pages the first time
===================================

Go to the directory where to put the pages.

    [ "X$APACHE_HTDOCS" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $APACHE_HTDOCS set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cd $APACHE_HTDOCS

Check out the pages from CVS.
    
    [ "X$CVSROOT" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $CVSROOT set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    [ "X$WELCOME_TAG" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $WELCOME_TAG set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cvs -d $CVSROOT login
    # Password is 98passwd
    cvs -d $CVSROOT co -r $WELCOME_TAG -d html COMP/WEBTOOLS/WelcomePages/

Update the front pages
======================

Go to the directory where to put the pages.

    [ "X$APACHE_HTDOCS" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $APACHE_HTDOCS set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cd $APACHE_HTDOCS/html

update the pages from CVS:

    [ "X$CVSROOT" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $CVSROOT set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    [ "X$WELCOME_TAG" = X ] && { echo 'Make sure you have $WELCOME_TAG set correctly. Ask if you do not know what to use.' && exit 1 ; }
    cvs -d $CVSROOT login
    # Password is 98passwd
    cvs -d $CVSROOT update -r $WELCOME_TAG
