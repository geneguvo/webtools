Controllers/SecurityModule:

Contains the web exposed portion of the SecurityModule. Handles
AJAX calls from masthead, to return the information displayed 
there, other security related pages (sign up info, for instance).
Will need to read SecurityModule cookies, but the actual setting 
of these will be done elsewhere (perl and Tools/SecurityModule).
